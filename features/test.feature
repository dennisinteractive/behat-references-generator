@test @api
Feature: Table
  In order to use tables to create content
  as a user,
  I want to use Table tests

  Scenario: Create content using one line
    Given a default "page" content
    Then I am on "/"
#    When I click "Page title from yml"
#
#    Then I should see "Page title from yml"
#    Then I should see "Page body from yml"
#
#    Then I should see "Tags:"
#    And I should see the link "Default Tag1"
#    And I should see the link "Default Tag2"
#    And I should see the link "Default Tag3"
